                <h1>Intro</h1>
                <p>
					The 10 Rings NFT Collection is a series of rings each having it's own meaning and power.
					Made from soul-atom, the 10 rings were forged by the Demon Angels to give power to Tserys, the guard of The Passage.
					Legend says The Passage was a portal to a world of immortality, wealth, Love and prosperity. Those deemed worthy enough
					to enter, would never come back. Some say it was by choice, others believe they were captive trying to get back.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over time, The Passage gained more and stronger enemies from those unwilling to accept their unworthiness. 
					For thousands of years wars were faught and lives were lost trying to force entrance into The Passage.
					Tserys remained unmatched in power. That is until, The Qwajiti Army was formed.
                </p>
				<p>
					The Qwajiti Army was made up of warriors weilding powers from beyond this world. It took over 100 years for The Qwajiti Army
					to defeat Tserys, but in the end access to The Passage was lost forever... Before Tserys accepted defeat, the rings were activated
					closing The Passage. Tserys' soul was absorbed into the rings and the rings vanished to the furtherst corners of existence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since that day, the rings were belived to be lost forever. Some thought they were destroyed. As centuries passed,
					the search dwindled into nothing more than a mythical story. However, for The Qwajiti Army the search has just begun. Word has
					spread that they've located the rings and are nearing closer every day. We don't know what they plan do to with the rings. In the 
					wrong hands, the rings can bring unimaginable terror. The rings belong in the hands of someone we can trust. Find the rings before they do.
				</p>
				
				<h1>The Rings</h1>
				<p>
					The rings were beleived to be a priceless asset that when worn would not only deliver untold power, but would also allow one to 
					control access to The Passage. Each of the 10 rings hold a unique power and meaning.<br/>
					
					(More information needs to be uncovered about the rings. Find them)
				</p>
					
				<h1>The Hunt</h1>
				<p>
					The clock is used to determine how long until The Qwajiti Army finds the current ring. The clock time will vary depending
					on how hard it is for The Qwajiti Army to get to it. Clues are released periodically through our social media and email. Be the first
					one to solve the puzzle and the ring will be sent to your wallet.
				</p>
				
				<h1>The Choice</h1>
				Once all of the rings are found, a choice must be made. 
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Keep the rings separated and hidden from The Qwajiti Army. This means the rings are
							stored in a wallet and never staked on this platform. The rings will remain forever.
						</p>
					</li> 
					<li>
						<p>
							Bring the rings together and re-open The Passage. Bringing the rings together means staking them on this platform. 
							This will give you access to The Passage and all of what it holds being distributed amogst the ring holders. But be careful!
							While the rings are staked, The Qwajiti will try to take them. To unstake and secure the rings, The Passage must be made whole.
							This option is good if the rings are not held by a single person. Teamwork will prevail.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Merge the rings into a chain. Merging the rings is the hardest option and the most powerful. To merge, all rings must be held by a single
							holder. The rings can then be staked on this platform which will transform the 10 rings into a 10-link chain. The chain not only gives 
							full access to The Passage but also gives power to defeat the Qwajiti Army. The chain's full capability is still unknown.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h1>The Qwajiti Army Rings</h1>
				<p>
					If The Qwajiti Army find the rings, we don't know what they'll do with them. Will they stake them to gain access or will they
					destroy them, leaving The Passage closed forever? Or perhaps something else... We don't want to find out.
